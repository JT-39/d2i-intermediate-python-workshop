# D2I Intermidiate Python Workshop

## End-to-End Data Workflow in Python

This repository contains course material demonstrating a **real-world, end-to-end data workflow** in Python.

The course covers:
- Ingesting data from SQL databases and flat files  
- Cleaning, transforming, and calculating metrics  
- Formatting and exporting outputs for downstream tools (e.g. Power BI)  
- Light dashboarding in Python  

By the end of the course, you will have a **single, production-style Python script** that runs from data extraction to final output in one click.

A strong emphasis is placed on:
- Writing reusable and well-structured Python code  
- Organising code across modules and scripts  
- Testing data pipelines and calculations  
- Professional syntax, formatting, and best practices  

This course builds on beginner-level Python and focuses on writing code suitable for real analytics and data engineering workflows.
